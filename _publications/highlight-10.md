title: Dynamic tracking of state anxiety via multi-modal data and machine learning

description: |
  - Existing measures of state anxiety, such as the commonly used State Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S), mainly rely on subjective questionnaires with low temporal resolution. Quantitative representations of state anxiety based on psychological and physiological responses are still lacking, which limits the dynamic tracking of changing state anxiety levels in an anxiety-inducing paradigm.
  - We propose a state anxiety dynamic tracking model based on psychological and physiological data, which reflects the dynamic changes of individual state anxiety under high temporal resolution. 
  - This model can accurately measure state anxiety at resting state using only objective and easily accessible physiological signals, providing a sensitive measure of state anxiety level for future research on affective brain-computer interaction and anxiety regulation.

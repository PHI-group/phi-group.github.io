<p align="center"><img style="width:90%" src="/img/publicpic/natural_indiv_psy_imag.png"></p>

- We developed a naturalistic imaging approach that helps to identify schizophrenia patients when they watch a movie in an MRI scan. This approach does not assume a common brain response of patients and, therefore, it is suitable for psychiatric applications where biological heterogeneity is a significant issue.

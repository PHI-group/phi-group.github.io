   - Brain development from 1 to 6 years of age anchors a wide range of functional capabilities and carries early signs of neurodevelopmental disorders. However, quantitative models for depicting brain morphology changes and making individualized inferences are lacking, preventing the identification of early brain atypicality during this period.

   - This work reveals age dependence of brain morphometrics in preschool children;
   - Constructs growth curve models for cortical thickness and volume of brain regions;
   - Proposes typical types of age dependence among cortical and subcortical regions;
   - Provides models for individualized evaluation of brain developmental states;
   - Accurate recognition of children with language developmental delay.

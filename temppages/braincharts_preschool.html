    <h1>Brain Charts for Preschool Children</h1>
    <p>The preschool brain growth chart provides a standardized model for the individualized and refined assessment of the golden period of brain development, and is a basic tool for children's brain research. A "brain development score" inferred from brain growth charts also helps in early identification of a variety of brain developmental disorders.</p>
    <p>We present growth charts of 90 brain regional morphometric features. 
        Please select sex, hemisphere, and a region name to view the corresponding growth charts.</p>
    <p>The growth charts were build based on brain images of 265 typically developing children.</p>
    <p>Please refer to the following paper for details:</p>

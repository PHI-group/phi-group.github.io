   The preschool brain growth chart provides a standardized model for the individualized and refined assessment of the golden period of brain development, and is a basic tool for children's brain research. A "brain development score" inferred from brain growth charts also helps in early identification of a variety of brain developmental disorders.

   Our research team is dedicated to constructing children's brain growth curves to implement individualized brain examinations and "brain development score" assessments. The team constructed a growth curve model of a total of 90 brain morphological features to assess the relative position of each brain structure in children within the same age and same sex population, revealing the developmental abnormalities of certain brain structures. We will continue to collect data and update these growth charts.

   We share the following resources:
   - The latest growth charts: [Preschool Brain Growth Charts](/temppages/braincharts_preschool.html);
   - [R objects of the growth charts](https://github.com/PHI-group/share_children_braincharts), for automated inferrence of "brain development score" for each feature;
   - [Sex-stratified brain templates for each year between the ages of 1-6](https://osf.io/fm7cq/).

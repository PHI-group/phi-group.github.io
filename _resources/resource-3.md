   - INCloud provides a full-stack solution for the entire process of large-scale neuroimaging data collection, management, analysis, and clinical applications.
   - It helps standardize the acquisition and pre- processing of neuroimaging data, making it easier to aggregate data collected by multiple teams.
   - INCloud implements a brain feature library that allows users to query, manage, analyze and share brain features, and therefore accelerates the utilisation of neuroimaging data.
   - WeProMRI<sup>TM</sup> is our implementation of a user-friendly website for automatical, parallel processing of multimodal brain MRI data. The pro-version of PHI-pipe with more functionalities underlies this website.
